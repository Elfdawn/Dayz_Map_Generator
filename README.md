# Dayz_Map_Generator

This python3 script allows for conversion of DayZ map tiles off Chernarus and Livonia into full sized PNG's. 
This requires conversion beforehand of the .PAA files to .PNG (I have Bash file for this if needed, contact)
When creating a map of Namalsk, edditting of the files values are required since it needs to be cut by 57pixels instead of 16px IIRC.
